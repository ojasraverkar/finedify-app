# Finedify - The Vernacular Investor Coach

Finedify is a comprehensive platform designed to improve financial literacy for new investors in India. It provides educational modules, quizzes, and a virtual portfolio trading simulator in a user-friendly, gamified environment.

## 🏆 Winning Features for the Hackathon

To stand out, we've integrated two high-impact features that define the Finedify experience:

### 🤖 AI-Powered Investor Coach
The heart of our platform. Users can ask any financial question in plain English and receive a simple, clear, and safe explanation from our AI coach. This feature directly addresses the "coach" aspect, providing instant value and guidance.

### 🔥 Gamified Learning Streak
To encourage consistent learning, we've added a "Daily Streak" to the dashboard. This gamification element motivates users to return daily, making financial education an engaging habit rather than a chore.
