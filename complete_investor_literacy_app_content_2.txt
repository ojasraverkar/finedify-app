Module 2: Risk & Return
2.1 Understanding Risk
Definition: Risk in investing is the possibility of losing money or not meeting expected returns.
Types of Investment Risk:
1.	Market Risk (Systematic Risk):
o	Affects entire market
o	Cannot be diversified away
o	Examples: Economic recession, interest rate changes, political events
2.	Company-Specific Risk (Unsystematic Risk):

o	Higher in small-cap stocks, real estate
o	Can force selling at unfavourable prices
5.	Currency Risk:
o	Relevant for international investments
o	Exchange rate fluctuations affect returns
o	Can be hedged but at a cost
2.2 Volatility
What is Volatility? Volatility measures how much a stock's price fluctuates over time. Higher volatility means larger price swings.
Measuring Volatility:
•	Standard Deviation: Statistical measure of price dispersion
•	Beta: Compares stock's volatility to overall market 
o	Beta = 1: Moves with market
o	Beta > 1: More volatile than market
o	Beta < 1: Less volatile than market
Volatility Implications:
•	High Volatility: Greater potential for both gains and losses
•	Low Volatility: More stable, but potentially lower returns
•	Volatility Clustering: Periods of high volatility tend to be followed by high volatility
Managing Volatility:
1.	Diversification: Spread investments across different assets
2.	Time Horizon: Longer periods reduce impact of short-term volatility
3.	Dollar-Cost Averaging: Regular investments reduce timing risk
4.	Position Sizing: Don't put too much in volatile investments
2.3 Drawdowns
Definition: A drawdown is the decline from peak to trough in investment value.
Key Metrics:
•	Maximum Drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline
•	Drawdown Duration: Time from peak to recovery
•	Recovery Time: Time to reach new highs after drawdown
Historical Examples:
•	2008 Financial Crisis: S&P 500 dropped ~57% from peak
•	COVID-19 Crash (2020): ~34% decline in 5 weeks
•	Dot-com Bubble (2000-2002): NASDAQ fell ~78%
Psychological Impact:
•	Drawdowns test investor patience and discipline
•	Many investors sell at the worst times
•	Understanding historical drawdowns helps set expectations
Drawdown Management:
1.	Stress Testing: Model portfolio performance in various scenarios
2.	Risk Budgeting: Limit exposure to high-risk assets
3.	Rebalancing: Maintain target asset allocation
4.	Emergency Fund: Avoid forced selling during drawdowns
2.4 Leverage Cautions
What is Leverage? Using borrowed money to increase investment exposure beyond what your capital would normally allow.
Types of Leverage:
1.	Margin Trading: Borrowing from broker to buy stocks
2.	Leveraged ETFs: Funds that use derivatives to amplify returns
3.	Options: Control large positions with smaller capital
4.	Forex: Currency trading often involves high leverage
Leverage Risks:
Amplified Losses:
•	2:1 leverage means 50% stock drop = 100% loss
•	Losses can exceed initial investment
•	Margin calls force selling at worst times
Interest Costs:
•	Borrowing costs reduce returns
•	Costs continue even when investments decline
•	Can create negative carry situations
Forced Liquidation:
•	Brokers can force selling to meet margin requirements
•	Often happens during market declines
•	Removes investor control over timing
Real Example: Investor buys $10,000 of stock with $5,000 cash + $5,000 margin:
•	Stock rises 20%: Gain = $2,000 on $5,000 = 40% return
•	Stock falls 20%: Loss = $2,000 on $5,000 = 40% loss
•	Stock falls 50%: Loss = $5,000 on $5,000 = 100% loss
Safe Leverage Guidelines:
1.	Start Small: Use minimal leverage initially
2.	Understand Costs: Factor in interest and fees
3.	Have Exit Strategy: Know when to reduce leverage
4.	Maintain Cushion: Don't max out available leverage
5.	Avoid Leveraged ETFs for Long-Term: Daily rebalancing causes decay
Module 3: Portfolio Diversification
3.1 Fundamentals of Diversification
Definition: Diversification is spreading investments across different assets to reduce risk without necessarily reducing expected returns.
Core Principle: "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"
Why Diversification Works:
•	Different assets react differently to economic events
•	When some investments decline, others may rise or remain stable
•	Reduces portfolio volatility without necessarily reducing returns
•	Mathematical benefit from correlation less than perfect (+1)
3.2 Sector Diversification
Major Market Sectors:
1.	Technology: Software, hardware, semiconductors
o	Characteristics: High growth potential, high volatility
o	Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Google
2.	Healthcare: Pharmaceuticals, medical devices, biotechnology
o	Characteristics: Defensive, steady demand, regulatory risks
o	Examples: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer
3.	Financial Services: Banks, insurance, investment firms
o	Characteristics: Interest rate sensitive, economic cycle dependent
o	Examples: JPMorgan Chase, Berkshire Hathaway
4.	Consumer Discretionary: Retail, automotive, entertainment
o	Characteristics: Economic cycle sensitive, consumer confidence dependent
o	Examples: Amazon, Tesla, Disney
5.	Consumer Staples: Food, beverages, household products
o	Characteristics: Defensive, stable demand
o	Examples: Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble
6.	Energy: Oil, gas, renewable energy
o	Characteristics: Commodity price dependent, cyclical

o	Characteristics: Interest rate sensitive, inflation hedge
o	Examples: American Tower, Simon Property Group
11.	Communication Services: Telecommunications, media
o	Characteristics: Steady demand, technology disruption risk
o	Examples: Verizon, Comcast
Sector Rotation Strategy: Different sectors perform better in different economic phases:
•	Early Recovery: Financials, Industrials, Materials
•	Mid-Cycle: Technology, Consumer Discretionary
•	Late Cycle: Energy, Materials
•	Recession: Utilities, Consumer Staples, Healthcare
3.3 Understanding Correlation
Definition: Correlation measures how similarly two investments move. Range: -1 to +1.
Correlation Levels:
•	+1: Perfect positive correlation (move exactly together)
•	0: No correlation (independent movement)
•	-1: Perfect negative correlation (move opposite directions)
Practical Correlation Examples:
•	High Positive Correlation (0.7-0.9): Large-cap US stocks with S&P 500
•	Moderate Correlation (0.3-0.6): US stocks with international developed markets
•	Low/Negative Correlation: Stocks with bonds, Gold with stocks during crises
Geographic Diversification:

2.	Bonds: Income, capital preservation
3.	Real Estate: Inflation hedge, income
4.	Commodities: Inflation protection, portfolio insurance
5.	Cash: Liquidity, stability
3.4 Rebalancing
What is Rebalancing? Periodically adjusting portfolio to maintain target asset allocation.
Why Rebalance?
•	Market movements change portfolio allocation over time
•	Forces "sell high, buy low" behaviour
•	Maintains intended risk level
•	Removes emotion from investment decisions
Rebalancing Example: Target: 60% stocks, 40% bonds After market rise: 70% stocks, 30% bonds Rebalance: Sell stocks, buy bonds to return to 60/40
Rebalancing Methods:
1.	Time-Based Rebalancing:
o	Monthly: High transaction costs, minimal drift
o	Quarterly: Balanced approach, most common
o	Annual: Lower costs, more drift allowed
2.	Threshold-Based Rebalancing:
o	Rebalance when allocation deviates by set percentage
o	Example: Rebalance if stocks exceed 65% or fall below 55%
o	More responsive to market conditions
3.	Combination Approach:
o	Check quarterly, rebalance if threshold exceeded
o	Balances cost control with risk management
Rebalancing Considerations:
•	Transaction Costs: Frequent rebalancing increases costs
•	Tax Implications: Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes
•	Market Conditions: Consider rebalancing during extreme moves
•	Life Changes: Adjust target allocation as circumstances change
Tax-Efficient Rebalancing:
1.	Use New Contributions: Add money to underweight assets
2.	Harvest Tax Losses: Sell losing positions to offset gains
3.	Asset Location: Hold tax-inefficient investments in retirement accounts
4.	Avoid Wash Sale Rules: Wait 30 days before repurchasing sold assets

4.3 Myths vs Reality
Myth 1: "Algorithmic trading guarantees profits" Reality: Algorithms can lose money, especially in changing market conditions. They require constant monitoring and adjustment.
Myth 2: "You need millions to start algorithmic trading" Reality: Basic algorithmic trading can start with modest capital, but sophisticated HFT requires significant resources.
Myth 3: "Algorithms always react perfectly to market conditions" Reality: Algorithms are based on historical data and may not adapt well to unprecedented market conditions.
Myth 4: "HFT manipulates markets" Reality: While controversial, HFT generally provides liquidity and narrows spreads, though it can amplify volatility during stressed conditions.
Myth 5: "Individual investors can't compete with algorithms" Reality: Retail investors have advantages like flexibility, longer time horizons, and lower regulatory constraints.
4.4 Safe Introduction to Rules-Based Strategies
Starting Simple: Begin with basic, well-understood strategies before advancing to complex algorithms.
Basic Moving Average Strategy:
IF (Short-term MA > Long-term MA):
    BUY signal
IF (Short-term MA < Long-term MA):
    SELL signal
RSI Mean Reversion:
IF (RSI < 30):
    Oversold - potential BUY
IF (RSI > 70):
    Overbought - potential SELL
Risk Management Rules:
1.	Position Sizing: Never risk more than 2% on single trade
2.	Stop Losses: Automatic exit if losses exceed threshold
3.	Daily Loss Limits: Stop trading if daily losses exceed limit
4.	Diversification: Don't put all capital in one strategy

How It Works:
1.	Accumulation: Fraudsters buy large quantities of low-priced stock
2.	Promotion: Spread false/misleading information to create buying interest
3.	Inflation: Stock price rises due to increased demand
4.	Distribution: Fraudsters sell their shares at inflated prices
5.	Collapse: Stock price crashes, leaving victims with losses
Common Pump and Dump Tactics:
•	Social Media Campaigns: Coordinated posts on Reddit, Twitter, Telegram
•	Fake Press Releases: Announce non-existent partnerships or contracts
•	Paid Promotions: "Stock newsletters" that don't disclose compensation
•	Celebrity Endorsements: Using influencers to promote stocks
•	Email Spam: Mass emails promoting "hot tips"
Red Flags:
•	Sudden, unexplained price spikes
•	Heavy promotion with limited company information
•	Promises of guaranteed returns
•	Pressure to "act now" or miss out
•	Unknown or recently incorporated companies
•	Low trading volume suddenly surging
Protection Strategies:
1.	Research Thoroughly: Check SEC filings, financial statements
2.	Verify News: Confirm press releases through multiple sources
3.	Avoid "Hot Tips": Be sceptical of unsolicited investment advice
4.	Check Promoter Compensation: Look for paid promotion disclosures
5.	Start Small: Never invest large amounts in unfamiliar stocks
5.2 WhatsApp and Social Media Tips
The Problem: Social media platforms have become breeding grounds for investment scams, with fraudsters using the appearance of legitimacy and social proof to deceive investors.
Common WhatsApp Scam Patterns:
1.	"Exclusive" Groups: Invitation to join "VIP" investment groups
2.	Fake Success Stories: Screenshots of huge profits (easily fabricated)
3.	Guru Mentality: Someone claims special knowledge or inside information
4.	FOMO Tactics: "Limited time" opportunities that require immediate action
5.	Testimonial Fraud: Fake customer reviews and success stories
Red Flags in Social Media Investment Advice:
•	Unsolicited messages about investment opportunities
•	Claims of guaranteed returns or "risk-free" investments
•	Requests for personal financial information
•	Pressure to invest quickly without due diligence time
•	Reluctance to provide verifiable company information

2.	Independent Research: Never rely solely on social media information
3.	Be Skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is
4.	Avoid Pressure: Legitimate investments don't require immediate decisions
5.	Report Suspicious Activity: Contact relevant authorities about scams
5.3 Guaranteed Return Traps
The Fundamental Truth: There is no such thing as a guaranteed high return investment without corresponding risk.
Common "Guaranteed Return" Scams:
1.	High-Yield Investment Programs (HYIPs):
o	Promise extremely high returns (20-50% monthly)
o	Claim to use sophisticated trading strategies
o	Actually Ponzi schemes that eventually collapse
2.	Affinity Fraud:
o	Target specific communities (religious, ethnic, professional)
o	Use trusted community members as unwitting promoters

The Risk-Return Relationship:
•	Higher potential returns always involve higher risk
•	"Guaranteed" high returns violate basic financial principles
•	Diversification can reduce risk but not eliminate it
5.4 General Fraud Prevention
